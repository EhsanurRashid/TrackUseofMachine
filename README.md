<h1>Machine Usage Reporting Script (Coursera Project)</h1>

This repository contains a Python script designed to generate a daily report that tracks user connections to machines on a company network. This project was developed as part of a Coursera course and demonstrates practical skills in network event data analysis.

<h2>Problem</h2>

The IT department requires a daily report to monitor user activity on company machines. This report should identify which users are currently logged in to specific machines.

<h2>Solution</h2>

This script leverages a pre-existing system that collects network event data, including user login and logout events. The script parses this data to determine which users are actively connected to which machines at a specific point in time.

<h2>Features</h2>

*Analyzes user login and logout events from network event data logs.
* Generates a daily report summarizing current user connections to machines.
* Provides a clear and concise output format.

<h2>Benefits</h2>

* Enhances IT department's visibility into user activity on company machines.
* Aids in monitoring potential security concerns or unauthorized access attempts.
* Provides valuable insights for resource allocation and machine usage optimization.

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

* IT professionals, network administrators, and system security specialists.
* Individuals seeking to learn Python scripting and network event data analysis.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<b>Prerequisites:</b>

* Python
* Required libraries (list the specific libraries your script uses)

<b>Execution:</b>

1. [Run the script using the Python interpreter] (pythonscript).

## Disclaimer

This script is designed for educational purposes.

## Further Development

* Enhance script functionality to track login duration or connection timestamps.
* Implement error handling for potential data inconsistencies or missing files.
